Basic depth first search AI exercise that plays a mini game: given 5 numbers and 1 goal number it must calculate using the 5 numbers all the possibilities and combinations in order to reach the goal number (or as close as possible). I used Java and Javafx. The animated particle background is a webview through JavaFx into an html page with javascript files for the animation.
